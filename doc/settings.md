#### Changing some settings ####

Some behaviors and preferences as icons, classes, column sizes, etc. can be changed from:

```

	├── config/
	│	└── cruds/
	│		└── settings.php

```

Of course, also you can modify same preferences but for a resource only, in this case you may add for example:

```

	├── config/
	│	└── cruds/
	│		├── employees/	
	│		│	└── settings.php		**employee resource settings only**
	│		└── settings.php  			**general setting**

```
